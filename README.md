# Running Watch
 An embedded system project where an Atmel SAM4L8 board was transformed into a running watch with GPS and heart rate capabilities.

 This project was completed with Seth Shively and Kate Kilpatrick.
 I was in charge of the heart rate implementation, and details can be found in the Final Report.
